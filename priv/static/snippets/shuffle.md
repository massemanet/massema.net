INT. CRUFTY BASEMENT BAR - NIGHT

Three glum-looking men in their late twenties are seated around a table full of
empty beer glasses. They are overweight and have very questionable haircuts,
and yet they're strangely attractive. They each clutch a half-empty beer.

        JW

    I don't want to AWP anymore. I'v alway been an entry fragger at heart.

        KRIMZ

    I'm tired of that little guy acting like he can tell me what to do. I want
    a real caller.

        FLUSHA

    I don't want to AWP or call. If only we could find an AWPer and a caller.

        KRIMZ

    What about that Russian guy, Single?

        JW

    I don't think he speaks Swedish.

        KRIMZ

    Really? Nevermind then.

        FLUSHA

    Excluding us three, there's only one good Swedish caller, and one good
    AWPer. And they both play for NiP. Those guys have all the luck.

        KRIMZ

    Yeah. Existens and Drake, right?

        JW

    Existens... Isn't he French?

        KRIMZ

    No, the other one. Small guy, weird bans.

        JW

    Right. Yeah, he's OK. And Drake... he's the guy from that meme, right.

        KRIMZ

    I guess.

        FLUSHA

    Sounds right. But there's no way we can get those guys. [sighs]

They glumly empty their beers.
A fourth guy appears, clutching four, suspiciously pale, beers.

        JUMPY

    Hey guys! Guess who just got kicked by NiP!
