I wore out the CapsLock key on my Air. As one does.

Turned out the cost of replacing the keyboard was 300 Euro. So, the challenge
was clear; build a machine that is superior to the Macbook for coding, for less
than 300 Euro.

I got a refurbished Thinkpad for 220 Euro from [amazon.de]. More specifically,
an X220 with a German keyboard.
