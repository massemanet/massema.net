Modern Languages
================

Everything's Turing complete, so who cares?

* Managed memory
* Compiles to static binary
* A solid concurrency story
* Typing should be strong, static, and inferred
* Good library support

1.   JavaScript / TypeScript / CoffeeScript

Interpreted, with managed memory. Laughs at typing. The concurrency story is
that concurrency is just a myth. Tons and tons of, mostly totally crap,
libraries. Dependency hell in spades. But has a pretty solid core. Most of its
flaws are because its design goal to never give up, even if the program is
nonsense.

2.   Java

Byte code interpreted, with managed memory. Solid type system. The concurrency
story is pretty weak, OS threads. Tons and tons of libraries. Everything Java
is incredibly slow, bureaucratic, over-engineered, and will eat your
soul. Impossible to use without an IDE. Can run fast.

3.   Python

Has all the same weaknesses as javascript, but also tries to be object oriented
and lacks javascript's intellectual honesty. Everything is magic. In addition
to regular dependency hell there's two subtly incompatible versions of the
language.

4.   PHP

Combines the worst traits of Python and Perl. A complete train wreck.

5.   C#

Basically Java, somewhat improved, and only available for Windows.

6.   C++

So some idiot thought that what C needed was object orientation. This was of
course idiotic, and coupled with the vast accumulation of features, it's
basically unusable unless you stick to a subset. Obviously everyone uses a
different subset.

7.   Ruby

Essentially a minor rewrite of Python.

8.   C

One of the finest intellectual achievements of the 20th century. Portable
machine code! How cool is that? By 2020 standards, it lacks a type system and
managed memory, but by the standards of its time it's outstanding.

9.   Objective-C

Basically C++ (C + object orientation), but weird and Apple only.

10.  Scala

Pro; has a lot of cool features
Con; has every feature ever invented. Also, basically Java.

11.  Shell / PowerShell

bash, in particular, is three things. A really REALLY bad language, a REPL, and
an interactive interface to the kernel (syscalls). As such, should not be
judged by the standards of other languages.

12.  Swift

Basically C#, but for Apple.

13.  R

PHP for statisticians.

14.  Go

Hits all the right spots. Only drawback is that is manages memory by GC. So, a slightly worse rust.

15.  Perl

An interesting experiment in language design by just slapping stuff on top of
other stuff (see scala and PHP). In this case that base was bash (see wiz). So,
an unmitigated disaster. Tons of libraries though.

16.  Haskell

Intellectually stimulating/challenging. Fails on concurrency and its lack of
focus (it's a research project, and it shows).

17.  Clojure

Just what we needed! A Java without the type system! Idiotic idea.

18.  Lua

Running out of snark on this one.

19.  Groovy

Another Java without the type system. What's wrong with people?

20.  Visual Basic

Basically bash for Windows.

21.  Rust

Over time, it has become clear that what C needed was not object orientation,
but a type system and managed memory. Rust is that.

22.  Erlang

Not great unless you want a great concurrency story and/or telco libraries. If you do, it's great.

23.  F#

ML for Windows. Sadly not very popular.

24.  Assembly

Your basic bazooka; powerful, but a pain to deal with and you'll blow your foot off.

25.  Dart

Basically javascript. Why does this thing even exist?
