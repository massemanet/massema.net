Control keys
============

I've worn out the caps lock key on my Macbook Air (mid-2011). Because Apple, I
can't switch out the keyboard myself, so it'll probably be around $300.

Hence, I bought a Thinkpad X220 from amazon.de (220 euro) and a replacement
keyboard (40 euro). (Turns out German computers have weird German keyboards.)

I'll probably end up fixing the Macbook too.
