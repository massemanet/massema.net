Control keys
============

I've worn out the caps lock key (remapped to control, of course) on my Macbook
Air (mid-2011). Because Apple, I can't switch out the keyboard myself, so it'll
probably be around $300.

So, the challenge was clear; build a machine that is superior to the Macbook
for coding, for less than 300 Euro.

Hence, I bought a Thinkpad X220 from amazon.de (220 euro) and a replacement
keyboard (40 euro). (Turns out German computers have weird German keyboards.)
That machine has since been fried by a bad displayport cable, and I bought
another one with a weird Swedish keyboard.

I'm typing this on that machine. It has a pretty excellent keyboard, as far as
laptops go, and the hardware is surprisingly adequate for coding. Moore's Law
pretty much gave up right around 2011 or so when this machine was built.
